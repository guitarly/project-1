Card game

Catte Instruction

Catte is a game that requires tricks for the purpose of winning the last round. Its rules are somewhat like the Chinese game of Tien Gow, but this game uses the western card instead of the dominoes.

Each player will be dealt six cards at the beginning. At each round, the leader in that round will start with a card. Other players in rounds either drop a card (face down) or use a card (face up card) with the condition being bigger and the same with the previous card. Any player playing the last card in a round will win that round and will lead the next round.

There are some exceptions in the fifth and sixth rounds. If any player fails to win a round in the previous four rounds, he or she will not be eligible for the last two rounds. And in the fifth round, only the top player for his / her card is up, all other players to place their cards face down. Round 6 will be automatically played after the end of the fifth
